This script is used to control the fan speed on a PowerEdge server. I've only used it on an R730XD but it should work with R720s as well. 
ipmitool needs to be at the specified path in order for this to work.

The ipmitool raw commands were adapted from here: https://github.com/tigerblue77/Dell_iDRAC_fan_controller_Docker/blob/master/functions.sh
